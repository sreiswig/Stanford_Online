\item \points{1a} {\bf Implement Fine Tune}

Implement the logic for fine-tuning, including selecting the parameters that will be fine-tuned (only the case for \texttt{`all'} for this question) in \texttt{ft.py:\allowbreak parameters\_to\allowbreak \_fine\_tune()}, and computing the loss and accuracy in \texttt{ft.py:\allowbreak get\_loss} and \texttt{ft.py:\allowbreak get\_acc}. You only need to complete the loss/accuracy calculations under \texttt{if logits.dim() == 2:} for this question.
