\item \points{2a} {\bf Implement Inner Loop}

In the \texttt{maml.py} file, complete the implementation of the \texttt{MAML.\_inner\_loop} which computes the task-adapted network parameters (and accuracy metrics). Pay attention to the inline comments and docstrings. \\ 
\textbf{Hint}: the simplest way to implement \texttt{\_inner\_loop} involves using \texttt{autograd.grad}.
