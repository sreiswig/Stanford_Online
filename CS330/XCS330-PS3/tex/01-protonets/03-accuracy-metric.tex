\item \points{1c} {\bf Evaluating Accuracy Metrics}

4 accuracy metrics are logged. For the above run, examine these in detail to reason about what the algorithm is doing.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Is the model placing support examples of the same class close together in feature space or not? Support your answer by referring to specific accuracy metrics.
    
    \item Is the model generalizing to new tasks? If not, is it overfitting or underfitting? Support your answer by referring to specific accuracy metrics.
\end{enumerate}
